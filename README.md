Purpose for this  program was to create artificial intelligence(AI) connect 4 game. One player will be user/in person and the other player will be the computer. It will be played like a normal connect 4 game and the AI will be able to play competively, making the right decsions and game moves. The AI will be able to detrmine when there is chance to win or even block the in person player from winning. Once the game is over then it will display a text, indicating which player has won and then terminate the program.

Key Concepts in this program was learning how to implment the AI algorithm, the AI I used in this program was the MiniMax algorithm. The Minimax is essentially a tree like structure and is able to traverse through the tree and select the best posssilbe outcome in a given situation. I also implemented the alpha beta pruning algorithm that works off of the minimax and used to decrease the number of nodes evaluated. Another core feature in this program, was using the library pygame which essntially created the main gaming screen.
